# What is Eaglercraft Reverse?

### Eaglercraft Reverse is a project dedicated to reverse engineering Minecraft versions with Javascript. This project was created because versions **1.13+** would be a living hell with preformance when running in a web browser, and Minecraft isn't really built to run in a web browser.

# Progress

## ***23% done*** (I just came up with this in my head)

## Release date prediction: ***May 25, 2025***

## Latest Update: **working on skins and menus**

## When it started: **Early September 2024** (I was on vacation for a while)
